## Introduction

Waste management plays an important role in reducing environmental pollution. This project uses a deep learning model to classify images of waste into two categories: **Organic** and **Recyclable**. We use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a popular model architecture for image classification tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building the deep learning model.
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For organizing and handling dataset.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and results.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains images of waste items, categorized into two main classes:
- **Organic**
- **Recyclable**

The images are stored in the `TRAIN` and `TEST` directories under the folder `DATASET\DATASET`.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/waste-management-cnn.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Make sure to have the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- tqdm

3. Ensure that the dataset is placed in the correct directory structure

## Usage

To train the model, run the following Python script:
python train_model.py

This script will process the images in the `TRAIN` directory, visualize the distribution of the categories, and train a CNN model to classify waste items.

## Output

Upon running the script, you will see a pie chart visualizing the distribution of the images across the two categories, **Organic** and **Recyclable**. Below is an example output of the visualization:

### Example of Distribution of Categories


Organic: 52.36%
Recyclable: 47.64%

The pie chart helps you understand the balance of data between the two categories before training the model.
